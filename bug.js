The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase related to data fetching and asynchronous operations:

```javascript
// Incorrect data fetching and handling
db.ref('users').once('value').then(snapshot => {
  const users = snapshot.val();
  // ... perform some operation that depends on 'users'
  // Attempt to access data outside of the Promise chain
  console.log('Outside Promise:', users);
});

// ... other code that might execute before the Promise resolves
console.log('This might execute before data is fetched');
```

The problem lies in attempting to access the `users` data outside of the Firebase Promise chain.  Because Firebase's `once()` method is asynchronous, the code accessing `users` outside of `.then()` might run before the data has finished loading, resulting in `users` being undefined or null. This can lead to unexpected errors or incorrect application behavior.
