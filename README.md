# Uncommon Firebase Bug: Asynchronous Data Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error when working with Firebase's asynchronous data fetching mechanisms.  The bug highlights the importance of properly handling asynchronous operations within Promise chains or using async/await.

## The Bug

The primary issue is accessing data fetched from Firebase outside of the Promise resolution, leading to undefined values and unexpected behavior.

## The Solution

The solution involves ensuring all data-dependent operations are encapsulated within the Firebase Promise's `.then()` block or using `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous code.
